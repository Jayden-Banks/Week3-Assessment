How does the internet work?
The internet requires a bunch of different computers to be physically or wirelessly linked together. Computers have different categories they
fall under that each help create the internet. Servers, routers, databases, and user computers all play a part. Connections for these computers 
span across the world. 
A webpage is accessed by its unique ip address usually converted from its domain name. That ip address is found through the local cache, router, ips, or root. A request is then sent to that ip
address and the listening computer will send back a response with the data attached with html and other code to display the webpage and have it work.

What happens when you click on a link?
A link is a url so your computer sends a request using that url for data and once a response is sent back from that ip address it will use the attached code
to display the new page or content using a combination of html incased with javascript and css for styling. Like the answer up above the computer might have to
finde the ip address by using the DNS and a combination of other computers to eventually make the initial request.
